# Loiter üê¢

Loiter the lazy tortoise wants you to do less and get more done when it comes to
tracking your time.

## Overview

Loiter is a time tracking tool and Rust library (yes, yet another one, because
to get the UX you want you've often got to build it yourself). It's inspired by
[Watson]. It stores its data in plain old text files that're easy to `grep`,
`jq` and commit to a Git repository.

At present, it primarily provides a command line-based interface for:

- Managing projects
- Managing tasks related to projects
- Tracking time worked on specific tasks and/or projects
